  <h1>What Clients Say — Full Testimonials</h1>

  <div class="testimonial">
    <p>Working with Sam Fahlberg completely changed the trajectory of my career. As a woman in engineering, I struggled with imposter syndrome, constantly doubting my abilities and place in a male-dominated field. Through his patient mentorship, honest feedback, and unwavering belief in my potential, he helped me overcome those self-doubts and grow into a confident, capable engineer. His leadership didn’t just sharpen my technical skills—it reshaped how I saw myself. I went from second-guessing everything to owning my ideas and leading with conviction. Anyone lucky enough to work with him is in for something truly transformative.</p>
